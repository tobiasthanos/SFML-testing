IMPORTANT: SFGUI is heavily under development. Keep in mind that code which is
actively being developed may fail on your system or behave strangely.


1. INSTALLING

Dependencies:
  - SFML 2 (http://sfml-dev.org/)
    There's currently no SFML 2 release, therefore you need to build from the
    sources (use the official Git repository, latest commit).

The current build system in use is CMake (http://cmake.org/). It's available
for all major platforms.

To build, perform the following steps:

  - Create a separate directory for the build files, e.g. "build".
  - Move into that directory.
  - cmake ..
  - make install

The library is now ready to use.


2. USING SFGUI IN OWN PROJECTS

To use SFGUI in your projects, you have to link to the SFGUI library (see 1 for
building), e.g. libsfgui.so on Linux. Also make sure that your compiler is able
to find SFGUI's include files.

If you're using CMake for your project and you've properly installed SFGUI (see
1), you can automate the process of finding SFGUI by doing:

  find_package( SFGUI REQUIRED )
  include_directories( ${SFGUI_INCLUDE_DIR} )
  add_executable( my_program ... )
  target_link_libraries( my_program ... ${SFGUI_LIBRARY} )

In case CMake can't find your SFGUI installation, you can still specify the
path manually by setting the SFGUIDIR CMake variable.

Keep in mind that you still have to link to SFML2 (minimum system, windows and
graphics).


3. DOCUMENTATION

You can find the API documentation in the doc sub-directory. Create it with
Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

It's also available online at the website.
